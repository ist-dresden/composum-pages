Composum Pages is the content management feature of the Composum Platform. This module supports the creation and
manipulation of content pages as arrangements of content components. The Pages feature defines a framework to implement
editable Sling components. The editing user interface of Composum Pages is a powerful tool to set up sites, create and
manage pages and to edit the pages content.

Pages is providing an user interface to manipulate your content in an
intuitive way. The content in the Composum Pages CMS is organised in

- Sites: the managing entry point to one site on the platform which contains all pages and assets and declares the
  releases, languages and all settings for the pages of that site
- Pages: a page represents a page in the Web; the page hierarchy determines the navigation of a site; pages are
  versioned and the versions of the pages are organised in the site releases
- Containers and Elements: the content pieces of a page are arranged in containers placed on a page with more or less
  complex content elements within
